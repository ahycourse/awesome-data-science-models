# Black Friday Exercise

You will have to copy the contents of answers folder (Excuding AI Platform Notebook.)

Run through the cells to create a random forest model to predict a category type given a customer's previous Black Friday purchasing behavior.

You will have to complete the informations in the cells wherever prompted.

On the Google Cloud Platform, you can run it locally, meaning in your persistent, but small, terminal environment, or on the AI Platform.

The notebook also shows you how to package the resulting model into gzipped file that you can then load onto AI Platform to serve and make dynamic predictions.
